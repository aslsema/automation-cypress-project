#  🧪 Cypress Automation Test Project
## 📖 Project Description
🚀 An end-to-end test automation project built with Cypress, using the Page Object Model (POM) architecture and Mochawesome reporting.
This project contains end-to-end (E2E) automated tests for an e-commerce web application.
All test scenarios are designed based on real user behaviors and critical business flows.
The main goal of this project is to automatically validate key user journeys, reduce regression risks, and provide clear, reportable test results.

## 🧩 Project Overview
•	6 test specification files, each representing a User Story
•	Tests are written in a modular and scalable structure
•	Covered user flows:
  o	User Authentication
  o	Product Search and Listing
  o	Product Detail Page & Add to Cart
  o	Cart Management and Validation
  o	Checkout and Order Confirmation
  o	Guest User Shopping Flow

## 🔧 Technologies Used
•	Cypress – End-to-End Test Automation
•	JavaScript
•	Mochawesome – Test Reporting
•	Node.js / npm
•	Git & GitHub
